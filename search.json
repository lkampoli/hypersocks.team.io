The aim of UnDiFi-2D is to explicitely manage discontinuities in the flow field. In our unstructured shock-fitting approach the shock front is described using a double-sided, polygonal curve. Two sets of flow states, corresponding to the upstream and downstream sides of the discontinuity, are assigned to the grid-points located on either side of the shock front. This is allowed to move, while obeying to the Rankine-Hugoniot jump relations, throughout a background triangular mesh that covers the entire computational domain. At each time step, a local, constrained Delaunay triangulation is applied in the neighbourhood of the shock front to ensure that the edges that make up the shock front are part of the overall triangular grid. The fitted shock acts as an interior boundary for the shock-capturing solver that is used to solve the discretised governing equations in the smooth regions of the flow-field.\nML4STS: Machine Learning for State-To-State This project aims at investigating the usage of machine learning algorithms for Tthe solution of high-speed (viscous and inviscid, reacting and non-reacting) non-equilibrium flows according to a state-to-state (STS) formulation. Several machine learning methods, including neural networks are considered.\nINNA: Introduction to NoNequilibrium Applications This is CFD solver which aims at simulating non-equilibrium flows using different levels of approximations: one-temperature (1T), multi-temperature (MT), state-to-state (STS). The modular design favors the addition of new models or functionalities in a straightforward manner.\nGEP: Gene Expression Programming EVE3 is a machine learning framework based on evolutionary algorithms implemented in Python 3. The framework is mostly used to perform symbolic regression via Gene Expression Programming. EVE3 is capable of regressing multiple mathematical equations simultaneously, scalar, vectorial and tensorial, training the equations towards multiple objectives, using variables of arbitrary dimensionality and evaluating the equations with external software.",
