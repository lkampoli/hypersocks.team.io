Hello! I'm Jorge! I have a B.A. in Public Policy and a passion for using data to inform decision-making. My interests include:

- üéØ Data Science for Public Policy: I'm in my second year of the Master's degree in Data Science for Public Policy at Hertie School in Berlin, Germany. I believe that data science can be a powerful tool for addressing complex public policy challenges, and I'm excited to continue exploring this field. My interest is use data science as a tool to inform decision-making and maximize the impact of a policy in real and complex environments. contexts

- üè¢ Work: I'm involve in multiple research projects within the Project for Analysis and Decision in Uncertain Contexts. For example, I've been estimating the force of infection of the bacteria Helicobacter Pylori (which causes gastric cancer) on the US population using catalytic models. Also, I've started to implement Discrete Event Simulation in the natural history of colorrectal cancer as well as other activities related to cancer research for different CISNET groups.

- üèõ Teaching and Education: I'm passionate about teaching. I've worked as a teaching assistant for courses on quantitative methods and public policy evaluation. I'm also the founder of the Hertie Coding Club, a space where students can learn programming skills for data analysis, wrangling and public policy.

- üé´ Memberships: I'm part of the Gastric Cancer Group from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET); Trainee member of the Society for Medical Decision Making (SMDM) and a member of Stanford's Data Science x Decision Science DS^2 group.
