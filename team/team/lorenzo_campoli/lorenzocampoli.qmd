Hello! I'm Lorenzo. I received a Ph.D. degree in Theoretical and Applied
Mechanics from Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Sapienza
University of Rome, Italy in 2016. I was a PostDoc researcher at
Saint-Petersburg State University unitl 2022. After that I obtained a
professorship from the same University. I'm currently a research fellow at the
University of Melbourne and Associate Professor at Macquarie University.  My
main research interests include:

- shock-fitting numerical techniques

- high-speed nonequilibrium flows modeling

- data-driven turbulence model closure

- machine learning for CFD
