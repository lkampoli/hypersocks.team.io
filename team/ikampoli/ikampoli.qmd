I am a doctoral student in Health Policy at Stanford University and a
Fulbright-García Robles scholar. Before beginning my PhD at Stanford in 2022, I
worked as a research assistant at the Center for Research and Teaching in
Economics (CIDE) in Mexico. My research interest is to identify cost-effective
air pollution mitigation strategies to support decision making. I have
experience coding in R, Matlab, C++, Python, LaTeX and would like to learn
more. I love cats (I have four), hiking, swimming and teaching. I'm excited to
be a part of the Hertie Coding Club and learn from you and share my knowledge
and skills with you too!
