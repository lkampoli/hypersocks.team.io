## About ON Prime

![](./images/ONBanner.jpg)

ON Prime gives researchers the skills and confidence to undertake customer
discovery and market validation activities that enable them to take their
research further.

ON Prime is a free program designed to help research teams of two to five
people take their projects to the next level through customer discovery
activities and more. We work with researchers at any stage of their project
across all disciplines.

During the nine weeks of ON Prime, you will develop a deeper understanding of
the people who could benefit the most from your research and sharpen your
skills to communicate with that audience.

Expert facilitators will support you to build evidence for the impact of your
research, so you can make a difference in the world and attract the resources
you need along the way.
